# BingImageDownloader

## Introduction

Because I like the Bing Wallpapers yet I don't want to install anything on my machine nor download them manually.

So a developer gotta develop. So here's a .NET Core version that will download the last batch of wallpapers to a specified directory. 


## Running the project


Once the repository is cloned, just type the following command in the cloned folder: 

```bash
dotnet run --project src/BingImageDownloader.Client "<PATH WHERE TO DOWNLOAD>"
```
